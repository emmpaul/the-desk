# syntax=docker/dockerfile:1

# =============================================================================
# Production image for self-hosting (build-from-source at a release tag).
#
#   git checkout vX.Y.Z
#   ./docker/gen-secrets.sh
#   # in .env, extend the COMPOSE_FILE the template ships so the build overlay
#   # (docker-compose.build.yml) stacks on top and restores a local `build:`:
#   COMPOSE_FILE=docker-compose.prod.yml:docker-compose.build.yml
#   docker compose up -d --build
#
# Development still uses Laravel Sail (compose.yaml); this image is a separate
# production path and does not replace it. Served with FrankenPHP (Caddy + a
# built-in PHP SAPI) in classic mode: one process per container, no nginx +
# PHP-FPM + supervisor juggling, and no extra Composer dependency (unlike
# Laravel Octane).

# gd/imagick: image processing for attachments (Intervention Image, installed via
# Composer) — EXIF-stripping and thumbnail generation. Imagick is the default
# driver (ATTACHMENT_IMAGE_DRIVER); GD is the fallback.
# ldap: directory bind authentication (LdapRecord); required by the package even
# when LDAP is not configured, since the extension is a hard dependency.

# The redis extension is fetched from pecl.php.net, so a PECL outage reds the
# whole Docker workflow on a commit that changed nothing (#626). CI caches this
# layer, so an outage is only ever reached on a real rebuild; retry with linear
# backoff to ride out the rest. A genuine error (a missing or incompatible
# extension) fails without touching the network, so it costs at most the 100s of
# backoff before giving up — bounded, not a multi-minute hang.

# The FrankenPHP base image ships a HEALTHCHECK that curls Caddy's admin API on

# (web server, reverb, queue:work, schedule:work), and only the web role serves
# Caddy — so that inherited probe would report the other three permanently
# unhealthy. Drop it and let docker-compose.prod.yml declare a real healthcheck
# per service where one is meaningful (the HTTP-serving `app` and `reverb`); the
# non-HTTP `queue`/`scheduler` workers intentionally run with no healthcheck.
