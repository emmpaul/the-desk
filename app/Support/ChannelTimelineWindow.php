/**
 * Resolves where a channel's initial message window opens and assembles the
 * timeline and thread payloads a channel view renders.
 *
 * This is the read-model behind {@see ChannelController::show()}:
 * the most regression-prone logic in the app — unread-boundary anchoring, jump
 * context, and page-size arithmetic. It takes explicit parameters (no `Request`)
 * so the window math is unit-testable without an HTTP round-trip. The controller
 * keeps HTTP glue only: resolve params from the request, call this, render.
 *
 * The two request-derived ids (`$requestedJumpId`, `$requestedThreadRootId`)
 * arrive raw from query params, so they are typed `mixed` and validated here —
 * a tampered non-string or a message from another channel resolves to null.
