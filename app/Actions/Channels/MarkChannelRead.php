     * mention badges. A channel with no messages leaves the pointer untouched,
     * and a non-member is a no-op because there is no pivot row to update.
     *
     * A real advance broadcasts two independent signals. {@see ReadStateAdvanced}
     * always goes to the reader's own other devices so their sidebar badge
     * clears there too, skipping the device that just read (it already gets
     * fresh counts in this request's response). {@see MessageRead} goes to peers
     * so they can update their "Seen by" affordance, and only for a user who
     * shares read receipts — that preference governs what peers see, never
     * whether a user's own devices stay in step. The advance guard keeps both
     * silent on the frequent no-op calls the client fires on every incoming
     * message and window focus.
