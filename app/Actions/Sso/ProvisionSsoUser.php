     * Matching order: (1) an existing identity for this exact directory subject
     * wins, so a login survives the user's email changing at the IdP; (2) else a
     * user with the same email is linked (the directory has verified it), storing
     * the subject for next time; (3) else a new account is JIT-provisioned. New
     * accounts have no local password, are treated as email-verified (the IdP
     * verified them), and land in the default team as a Member.
     *
     * When $syncName is set, the mapped display name is refreshed from the
     * directory on every login for an already-existing account (a blank name is
     * ignored rather than wiping the current one). Directories that push
     * attributes on each bind — LDAP/AD — opt in; a JIT-created account already
     * carries the supplied name, so only the returning-user paths need it.
     *
     * $emailVerified is the caller's assertion that the directory vouches for
     * the email. Only OIDC passes it explicitly (derived from the UserInfo
     * `email_verified` claim — see OidcController), because a lax IdP will mint
     * tokens for a self-asserted address and email-matching would then hand the
     * attacker an existing local account. SCIM and LDAP callers rely on the
     * default: there the transport itself is the trust anchor (a bearer-token
     * push from the IdP, or a successful directory bind) and no equivalent
     * per-login claim exists to check. When the flag is false the sign-in is
     * rejected outright — no link *and* no new account, so an unverified email
     * cannot squat a future colleague's address either. The subject fast path
     * (matching step 1) is deliberately exempt: that user's identity was
     * already established, and their email is not being matched on.
