 * Creates a bot identity for a team and records it in the workspace audit log.
 *
 * A bot is a {@see UserType::Bot} user scoped to the team via `owner_team_id`
 * with no login password and a synthetic, non-routable email (bots never sign in
 * or receive mail). It is not attached to any channel here — posting stays
 * membership-gated, so an operator adds the bot to channels separately.
