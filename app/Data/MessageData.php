     * Build the DTO from a Message model.
     *
     * The message's `user` and `mentionedUsers` relations should be eager-loaded
     * to avoid N+1 queries. A soft-deleted message renders as a tombstone: its
     * body and mentions are never sent to the client, only the `isDeleted` flag.
     *
     * The `replyTo` relation is expected to be eager-loaded (with its own `user`
     * and `mentionedUsers`) when the message quotes a parent; a deleted parent
     * still resolves so the quote can render a stub. A tombstone carries no
     * quote of its own — a deleted message shows only its own placeholder.
     *
     * The `forwardedFrom` relation follows the same rules (eager-loaded with its
     * `user`, `channel`, and `mentionedUsers`) for a forwarded message.
     *
     * Thread aggregates (`threadReplyCount`, `threadLastReplyAt`,
     * `threadParticipants`) are structural, so they survive a soft delete — a
     * deleted root still shows its "N replies" affordance. `threadParticipants`
     * resolves from the eager-loaded relation when present, empty otherwise.
     *
     * `threadFollowed` and `threadUnread` are per-viewer and only populated when
     * the message was loaded through {@see ChannelController::withThreadReadState()};
     * elsewhere (broadcast payloads carry no viewer) they fall back to false and
     * the client keeps whatever state it already derived. `threadUnread` is the
     * conjunction of following the thread and it holding unread replies.
