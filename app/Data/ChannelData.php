    /**
     * Build the DTO from a Channel model.
     *
     * `unread_count`, `mention_count`, `muted` and `notification_level` are the
     * current user's per-channel state, populated only when the channel was
     * loaded for their sidebar or view; elsewhere they are absent and fall back
     * to the defaults (unmuted, "all", zero badges).
     *
     * The badge counts are suppressed here so the sidebar prop is authoritative:
     * a muted channel or the "nothing" level shows no badge at all, and the
     * "mentions" level keeps only the mention badge (a direct @mention still
     * alerts while ordinary unread traffic is silenced).
     *
     * The draft is the viewer's own pending composer text. The open channel
     * (`Show`) carries the full `draft` so the composer restores it; the sidebar
     * ships only the `has_draft` boolean, so `draft` stays null there and only
     * the presence cue is exposed.
     *
     * `starred` is the viewer's own favorite flag, driving whether the channel is
     * pinned to the sidebar's "Starred" section.
     *
     * `sectionId` is the custom section the viewer has filed the channel under
     * (null for the default "Channels" group), and `position` is its manual order
     * within whichever group it renders in.
