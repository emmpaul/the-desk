/**
 * Fired when a user's read pointer advances, so their *other* devices can drop
 * the channel's unread badge without waiting for a navigation.
 *
 * The increment direction already syncs across devices — every client watches
 * each `channel.{id}` and reloads the authoritative counts on a new message —
 * but clearing did not: reading on a phone left the desktop showing the channel
 * unread. This rides the reader's own private `user.{id}` channel, so nothing
 * about where they read leaks to peers, and it carries no counts: the client
 * responds by reloading the server-computed `channels` prop, reusing the
 * existing badge machinery rather than tracking counts of its own.
 *
 * Unlike {@see MessageRead}, this is dispatched regardless of the reader's
 * `share_read_receipts` preference — that toggle governs revealing read state
 * to *others*, not syncing a user's own devices.
