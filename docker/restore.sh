# Restore the production stack's durable state from a backup pair.
#
#   ./docker/restore.sh db-backup-YYYY-MM-DD.sql.gz storage-app-YYYY-MM-DD.tar.gz [--force]
#
# Restore is destructive in a way backup is not, so this script:
#
#   - refuses a non-empty database unless --force is passed, because psql
#     replaying a plain dump over existing tables produces a half-merged mess
#     rather than the backup you asked for;
#   - prints exactly what it will overwrite and asks for confirmation, which
#     --force also skips for non-interactive use (cron, CI);
#   - stops app, reverb, queue, and scheduler before touching anything, so
#     nothing writes to the database or the uploads mid-restore.
#
# Every check that can refuse runs *before* the stack is stopped, so a run that
# bails leaves the instance exactly as it found it.
#
# Those services are left stopped afterwards so you can check things over (pgsql
# stays up: it is what we restore into); bring everything back with
# `docker compose up -d`.
#
# No `-f docker-compose.prod.yml` here: .env sets COMPOSE_FILE, so a bare
# `docker compose` resolves the right files for both the published-image and
# build-from-source setups.
