# Upgrade the production stack in one command: back up, start the new release,
# and verify the instance is actually running it.

#
# BACKUP_DIR defaults to the current directory and is passed straight to
# docker/backup.sh, so the backup lands wherever you would have put it anyway.
#
# The target version defaults to the VERSION file in this checkout, which is the
# release the compose file pins. Pass --target only if you override APP_IMAGE to
# a tag that does not match the checkout.
#
# --timeout bounds the health check (default 300s). A cold boot runs migrations
# and rebuilds the search index (`search:sync`) before /up answers, so it is
# deliberately generous; raise it on a slow host or a large database.
#
# --no-pull skips `docker compose pull` and uses the image already on the host,
# for air-gapped hosts or when you pulled ahead of the maintenance window.
# Build-from-source setups never pull: the overlay is detected from COMPOSE_FILE.
#
# IT NEVER ROLLS BACK ON ITS OWN. Rolling back is not a git revert here, it is a
# destructive database restore, and this script cannot tell the two cases apart:
# a migration that genuinely broke the schema, and an app that is fine but whose
# /up did not answer inside the timeout (slow first boot, a wedged healthcheck, a
# proxy hiccup). In the second case an automatic restore is a data-loss event the
# script itself caused, destroying every message written since the dump, and it
# would fire at 2am under exactly the conditions where nobody can evaluate it.
# So on failure it stops, leaves the stack untouched for diagnosis, and prints
# the exact restore command with the paths filled in. You make that call.
#
# No `-f docker-compose.prod.yml` here: .env sets COMPOSE_FILE, so a bare
# `docker compose` resolves the right files for both setups.
