#!/bin/sh
#
# Upgrade the production stack in one command: back up, start the new release,
# and verify the instance is actually running it.
#
#   ./docker/upgrade.sh --target=X.Y.Z [BACKUP_DIR] [--timeout=SECONDS] [--no-pull]
#
# No git checkout: the release lives in .env as APP_VERSION, and the compose file
# pins the image to it.
#
# BACKUP_DIR defaults to the current directory and is passed straight to
# docker/backup.sh, so the backup lands wherever you would have put it anyway.
#
# The target version is APP_VERSION in .env. --target=X.Y.Z writes it for you
# before upgrading, so a routine upgrade is one command with no hand-edit; omit
# --target to run whatever APP_VERSION already holds (e.g. after editing .env
# yourself). It must match what the started container reports through app:version.
#
# --timeout bounds the health check (default 300s). A cold boot runs migrations
# and rebuilds the search index (`search:sync`) before /up answers, so it is
# deliberately generous; raise it on a slow host or a large database.
#
# --no-pull skips `docker compose pull` and uses the image already on the host,
# for air-gapped hosts or when you pulled ahead of the maintenance window.
# Build-from-source setups never pull: the overlay is detected from COMPOSE_FILE.
#
# Before starting the new release, .env is compared against the target's
# .env.prod.example (shipped inside the image) and any new settings are
# reported, so a feature toggle introduced by the release is never silently
# unset. On an interactive run you are offered to append them with the
# template defaults (existing keys are never touched); non-interactive runs
# only report. --sync-env appends without asking (for automation);
# --no-sync-env skips the check entirely. The check is a courtesy: whatever
# goes wrong with it (an image too old to ship the template, a missing
# docker/env-sync.sh), the upgrade itself proceeds.
#
# IT NEVER ROLLS BACK ON ITS OWN. Rolling back is not a git revert here, it is a
# destructive database restore, and this script cannot tell the two cases apart:
# a migration that genuinely broke the schema, and an app that is fine but whose
# /up did not answer inside the timeout (slow first boot, a wedged healthcheck, a
# proxy hiccup). In the second case an automatic restore is a data-loss event the
# script itself caused, destroying every message written since the dump, and it
# would fire at 2am under exactly the conditions where nobody can evaluate it.
# So on failure it stops where it is, prints the exact restore command with the
# paths filled in, and leaves the decision to you. Note "stops", not "reverts":
# if it got as far as starting the new release, those containers are up and
# their migrations have run. Nothing is undone on your behalf.
#
# No `-f docker-compose.prod.yml` here: .env sets COMPOSE_FILE, so a bare
# `docker compose` resolves the right files for both setups.
